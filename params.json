I'm learning Java, and am a Linux geek all over. My distro is Ubuntu, installed with Wubi. Yup, I have Windows. For when I'm coding in .NET. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that. Anyway, jQuery is my preferred JavaScript library, and I use it in pretty much all the JS I write unless it's so painfully simple. jQuery FTW.\r\nMy current website is called JSiVi. Visit it at [http://jsivi.uni.me](http://jsivi.uni.me) today. We have an active community.","tagline":"All the little ideas from Joshy K.","google":""}
